## Overview

The nonprofit foundation, Alphabet Soup, requires a tool to assist in selecting applicants for funding 
who have the highest chance of success in their ventures. The goal is to create a binary classifier using 
machine learning and neural networks. A provided dataset contains information on over 34,000 organizations 
that have received funding from Alphabet Soup in the past. The dataset includes several columns that capture
metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME: Identification columns that provide unique identifiers for each organization.
APPLICATION_TYPE: Represents the type of application submitted to Alphabet Soup.
AFFILIATION: Indicates the sector of industry to which the organization is affiliated.
CLASSIFICATION: Represents the government organization classification of each organization.
USE_CASE: Describes the purpose or use case for the funding requested by the organization.
ORGANIZATION: Indicates the type of organization (e.g., corporation, trust, association).
STATUS: Reflects the active status of the organization.
INCOME_AMT: Classifies the income level of the organization.
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Captures any special considerations mentioned in the application.
ASK_AMT: Represents the funding amount requested by the organization.
IS_SUCCESSFUL: Indicates whether the money provided to the organization was used effectively.

By utilizing the provided dataset and its features, the objective is to develop a binary classifier 
that can predict whether an applicant will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. This predictive model
will assist the business team at Alphabet Soup in making more informed decisions regarding funding allocation, 
ultimately improving the overall success rate of funded ventures.
